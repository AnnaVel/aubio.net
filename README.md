# aubio.net

This is [aubio](https://github.com/aubio/aubio) for .NET Standard, it works for desktop apps as well as store apps.

All stable types are available as .NET types, leveraging features like LINQ, IEnumerable<T>, IDisposable, typed-approach etc.

It still needs some polishing so expect some minor adjustments to the API, for the documentation you will have to refer to https://aubio.org/documentation for the time being.

Your feedback is welcome !
